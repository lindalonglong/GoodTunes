/*

The CSS file is being left empty for the time being.

Instead of using a .css file, we are including an html file with our styles within the <style></style> block on base. html

The reason for this is because our browsers save the styles.css file into the cache, meaning that if we update the
styles.css file, we won't see the updates on our website. This workaround ensures that the styles are re-compiled
every time.
