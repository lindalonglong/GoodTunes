# GoodTunes
This is our second trimester project for AP CS Principles. GoodTunes is an aspiring social media platform where users can select songs from a database to create playlists, then share those playlists with others. These songs will be analyzed and be selected in the overview for a "AP CSP Wrapped."

### How to run Goodtunes


# Goals

### ✔️ Completed Goals ✔️
* Create a working flask skeleton including working backend, a base.html with a working navbar, and appropriate .css files
* Build an attractive homepage UI based on our storyboard on canva
* CSV database of 400 most popular songs in different generes with metadata that will help with analysis in the future.
* Create login and signup pages that take in user information and use it to interact with a SQL database
* Build a search page with an attractive UI that is able to search the website for songs

### 📝 Future Goals 📝
* Auto-generated working user dashboard that are created via the SQL database
* "Edit my user" button that leads to a page that edits user information
* Allow users to view and "follow" other users, and have this displayed on the user dashboard
* APCSP Wrapped that analyzes data after multiple users have created accounts
